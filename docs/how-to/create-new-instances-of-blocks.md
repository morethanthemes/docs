# Create new instances (clones) of existing blocks and assign them to regions

Drupal 9 comes by default with a feature that allows you to create new instances of existing blocks and assign those in the theme regions.

1. Navigate to Home > Administration > Structure > Block layout
2. Locate the region that you wish to populate with your new block
3. For this region click on the “Place block” button
4. From the list that pops up, locate the block that you wish to place in this region
    - You could also use the filter field at the top to quickly search through the available blocks
5. Click the “Place block” button at the right of the specific block.
6. Configure the block as you would do with any other block
7. Save your configuration

## Remove blocks from regions

In Drupal 9 in order to remove a block from a region you should just delete it from the regions page. If you need to place the block in the future you could follow the above procedure to create a new instance of this block.
